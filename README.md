# California House Price Prediction

**Overview**  
This Python-based machine learning project predicts housing prices in California using real estate data. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, regression modeling, and evaluation — all within a Jupyter Notebook.

##  Workflow Overview

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   Load `housing.csv` and analyze descriptive statistics, feature distributions, and correlations.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, categorical encoding (if any), and split data into features (X) and target (y).

3. **Feature Engineering & Scaling**  
   Derive new features if applicable (e.g. rooms per household, income per capita) and apply scaling (e.g. `StandardScaler`).

4. **Model Training**  
   Train regression models—such as `LinearRegression`, `DecisionTreeRegressor`, or `RandomForestRegressor`—to estimate housing prices.

5. **Evaluation & Visualization**  
   Compare models using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R². Visualize predictions vs. true values with plots.

6. **Conclusion & Next Steps**  
   Summarize model performance and suggest improvements (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, advanced models, deployment).

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` for installing dependencies

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedBilalTanveer/House‑Price‑Prediction.git
   cd House‑Price‑Prediction
   ```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 - m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Then open `house_price_predictor.ipynb` and run through each cell.
